# Processor characteristics 

[Processor variables](https://go.dev/doc/install/source#environment) direct the Go compiler to use some processor instructions.
The variable has an effect only when cross-compiling or re-compiling go locally.
The intent is to ease the detection of processor characteristics and the set of the related processor variables.

## Linux

Pseudo-file `/proc/cpuinfo` is parsed to load processor flags.
Reported flags are used to determine version of processor.

## Windows

Win32 API call [`IsProcessorFeaturePresent`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-isprocessorfeaturepresent) is used to collect the features of the processor.

### AMD64

Several checks are available but not every instruction of each version.
Impact should be limited as the standard expects instructions to all be present for each version.
Level is set when all verifiable features are present.
Details are available in the structure `ProcessorFeatures`.

### ARM 

The availability of VFP defines level 6 or higher for GOARM.
If v8 instruction set is available, GOARM is unset and GOARCH is set to ARM64.
